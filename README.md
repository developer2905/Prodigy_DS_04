# Prodigy_DS_04
I'm excited to share my latest project on Analyzing and Visualizing Sentiment Patterns in Social Media Data! üåü This project was undertaken as part of my work with Prodigy Infotech. The objective was to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands by analyzing sentiment expressed in social media posts.

## Project Overview
In this project, I utilized Python and several of its powerful libraries, such as Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, to perform a comprehensive sentiment analysis. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the steps involved:

### **Data Collection üìÇ**:
- I gathered social media data from various platforms using APIs and web scraping techniques.

  
### **Data Preprocessing üßπ**:
- Cleaned the data by removing noise such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and punctuations.
- Tokenized the text and performed lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.

  
### **Sentiment Analysis üßê**:
- Used NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer to classify the sentiment of each post as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Calculated sentiment scores to quantify the intensity of sentiment expressed in the posts.

  
### **Data Visualization üìä**:
- Visualized the distribution of sentiments across different topics or brands using bar plots and pie charts.
- Created word clouds to highlight the most frequently mentioned words and phrases in positive and negative posts.
- Analyzed sentiment trends over time to observe changes in public opinion.

  
### **Insights and Conclusion üß†**:
- Identified key factors influencing public sentiment towards specific topics or brands.
- Provided actionable insights based on the analysis to help brands improve their public perception and marketing strategies.
